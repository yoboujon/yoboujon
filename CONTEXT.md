I started learning how to use computers at the age of 3 with a *Macintosh II*. I've always been fascinated by science, particularly the stars. During my adolescence, I began reverse-engineering the games I played and became interested in the hardware behind my computer. As an experiment, I dismantled my computer to explore its components and began writing *Windows* scripts to improve my workflow. At the same time, I took an interest in UI/UX design and photo manipulation using the *Adobe suite*.

Today, I primarily use *Linux* for both work and personal projects. Iâ€™ve started developing low-level code in **C**, **C++**, and occasionally **Rust**. I have a strong interest in user interaction, which is why many of my projects are graphically-oriented, utilizing various libraries or *even* web components. While I focus on performance and simplicity, I enjoy experimenting with new ideas to see how they might enhance specific use cases.
